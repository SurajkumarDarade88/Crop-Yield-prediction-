# Crop-Yield-prediction-
Predictions of yields of different indian crops using Machine Learning Technique
The indian crop data is available from year 1997 to 2020 for different states
Data is available for 55 different type of indian crops.
Other parameters such as season,rainfall,area cultivated,fertilizer used,pesticide used,crop production are also available for the ease in prediction
No Null values, duplicated values  are observed in the data
Crop yield is a continous value so Regression technique is used 
six different regression algorithams are used from which decision tree gives the best testing accuracy of 98%.
least testing accuracy is observed in linear regression model which is 35%.
